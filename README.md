# Module 304: App#3 - Your Idea

## Overview
Android development is not always as one-person show. Frequently, you will collaborate with other developers when building an application. The purpose of this assignment is to, not only continue practicing your Android skills, but also, practice working in teams. 

## Project Assignment
This is a **4-week team project** in which you and your teammates are required to create an Android application. **You and your teammates need to come up with an app idea and make such an idea a reality in Android development.** For inspiration on what to create, look at the file I provided in the LMS.

## Weekly Presentations
Every week, during the weekly lectures, each team is required to present their progress to the rest of the class. **At least one member of each team must be present each class.**

## Teams Assignment
The instructor will **randomly** assign the teams. If you do not know which team number you belong to, please contact the instructor. Keep in mind that it is mandatory to work in teams. You **cannot** work independently for this assignment

## Team Repository
Since this is a team project, there is **one repository per team**. You and your teammates must push your code to the same repository.
